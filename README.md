# Hello Everyone!

Many of you have asked which Minecraft launcher I recommend. Alright! First, I'll introduce my channel where I not only reveal but also review many launchers. Please check out my YouTube channel - [My YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUdk5CZfmvSIu9wmI-gx2wQ)

Now, let's get down to business! We'll discuss the vanilla version and the importance of open-source launchers. Let's start with those suitable for licensed users:

- **PrismLauncher** (User-friendly, a fork of MultiMC) - [PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/)
- **MultiMC** (The leading launcher, simple and convenient) - [MultiMC Releases](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/releases)
- **ATLauncher** (Mainly for mods but also good for vanilla survival) - [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/)
- **Modrinth App** (Perfect if you're looking for mods exclusively from Modrinth, with a user-friendly interface and functionality) - [Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app)

However, for those without a license but still eager to play Minecraft, consider these options:

- **XMCL** (A Chinese launcher, simple and open-source, funded by sponsors, with its own interface and extensive functionality) - [XMCL](https://xmcl.app/)
- **FluentLauncher** (Available only on Microsoft Store, user-friendly, visually appealing, with an experienced team behind it) - [FluentLauncher](https://fluentlauncher.natsurainko.work/)
- **UltimMC** (A fork of MultiMC, open-source, and regularly updated) - [UltimMC](https://github.com/UltimMC)

Ultimately, choosing a Minecraft launcher is your decision, so pick what suits you best. This list is compiled based on my current experiences, so please don't judge it too harshly.
